=====================

A Node.js program that provides a web service interface to the Stanford CoreNLP library.


Notes
=====
  - This project has just started development (October 2012)
  - We intend to provide a full interface to a local instance of the Stanford CoreNLP system.
  - We welcome contributions of partial implementations that you are no longer developing.
  - We welcome input on the web service interface design.
