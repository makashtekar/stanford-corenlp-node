stanford-corenlp-node
=====================

A Node.js program that provides a web service interface to the Stanford CoreNLP library.

Examples of using this package can be found in the [stanford-corenlp-node-example](/mhewett/stanford-corenlp-node-example) project.

Notes
=====
  - This project has just started development (October 2012)
  - We intend to provide a full interface to a local instance of the Stanford CoreNLP system.
  - We welcome contributions of existing implementations that you are no longer developing.
  - We welcome input on the web service interface design.

Update: 01 December 2012
===================
  - The package is nearing alpha stage.
  - We have a wrapper around the Stanford CoreNLP library that turns it into a server.
  - We have a Node.js package that talks to the server.
  - Configuration files define the NLP options.
  - We are finalizing the examples.
